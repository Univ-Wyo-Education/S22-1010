# Lecture 17 - Video Lecture - TensorFlow Intro

What is important about machine learning. 
It is that the computer can infer from a large set of data
results on new data that it has never seen before.

## TensorFlow HelloWorld

Start with a Hello World that should print out 
the version of tensor flow.

```
  1: # TensorFlow and tf.keras
  2: import tensorflow as tf
  3: 
  4: # Helper libraries
  5: import numpy as np
  6: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  7: 
  8: print("TensorFlow Hello World")
  9: print(tf.__version__)

```

## TensorFlow on codlab - google online system.

If you are using google colab, then [https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)
