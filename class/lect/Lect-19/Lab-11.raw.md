# Lecture 19 - Simple Linear Model

The example linear fit model uses an equation of 

```
y = 2x -1 
```

So the data looks like:

| x | y |
|-----|-----|
| -1 | -3 |
| 0 | -1 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 4 | 7 |


The code:

```
m4_include(linear1.py.md)
```








Create a new linear fit set of data with the equation

```
y = 4x - 6
```

Update the data and re-train the model to use the new set of
data.  Then do a perdition with it.
