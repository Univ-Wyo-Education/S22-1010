1. Overfitting - in the regular world.

	1. Cars and saftey

	2. "No child left behind": 
		"There is now a parent-led backlash against “over-testing,”
		and politicians in both major parties are paying attention.
		These parents point to the time spent administering the
		tests themselves as well as to the diversionary effects of
		high-stakes testing on curriculum and instruction—which
		include narrowed curriculum, teaching to the test, and time
		spent preparing for the high-stakes assessments."

2. Seeking a Minimum

What is machine learing
	1. Supervized
		Labeled Data < Features, Label >
			e.g. An Email, is or is not Spam
		New Un-Labeld data < Features, ???? >
		Model
			Map of < Features -> Lable >

	Key terms : Features, Labels, Model

	2. Example

		House - SqFt - v.s. Price
			$120 - good
			$136 - maybee
			$142 - too much
			$110 - something is wrong

		House Number of Bedrooms  v.s. Price
			1 br = 36k
			2 br = 52k
			3 br = 86k
			4 br = 102k

		Loss - L2 loss - , L**2 - square of abs of loss
			Minimize loss over entire data set.

		Model - ****************** Train - demo

		Linear regression

	Key Terms: Linear Regression
		 

	3. How a model "learns"

		Gradient Decent - this has a "tunable" paramter

		kkkkkk




We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are.


### Do A Predition using the "model" ###

# Given the input data (60, 25, 2), the line y = 0.5x + 2 should yield (32, 14.5, 3). Does the model agree?

print(model.predict([60, 25, 2]))
# True values to compare predictions against: 
# [[32.0]
#  [14.5]
#  [ 3.0]]

x = float(input("Enter a number> "))
pv = model.predict([x])

print ( "Input {x} Output {y}".format ( x=x, y=pv ) )
