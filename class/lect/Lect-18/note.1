Data on probability of automation are from "The Future of Employment:
How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerization?" by Carl Frey and
Michael Osborne. Data on average annual wage and typical educational
requirements are estimates for 2016 and 2014, respectively, from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average annual wage for three
occupations—actors, dancers, and musicians and singers—was calculated
by multiplying the average hourly wage by the number of hours in a
typical U.S. work year (1,790).
