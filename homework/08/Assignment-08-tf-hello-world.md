# Assignment 08 - Tensor Flow - Hello World

Due Mar 28


Take the code in 
[https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/S22-1010/blob/main/class/lect/Lect-17/tf_hw.py](https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/S22-1010/blob/main/class/lect/Lect-17/tf_hw.py) (from Lecture 17) and start with getting a hello-world to work.

Choose to work on Google's colab or on your own system.  

Link for colab.  [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Step 1 - get the sample to run.

Step 2 - take the longer classification example and work through all the sections of it and get it to run.

Take the time to step through each section and run it and test it - read the code.


Turn in: A pair of image screen capture of successfully running the code.
