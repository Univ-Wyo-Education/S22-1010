# Lab 11 - Finish the data cleanup.

Given the following code:
/Users/philip/go/src/github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/S22-1010/homework/11

[https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/S22-1010/blob/main/homework/11/lab-11_start.py](https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/S22-1010/blob/main/homework/11/lab-11_start.py)

```
m4_include(lab-11_start.py)
```

And the data

[https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/S22-1010/blob/main/homework/11/train-data.csv](https://github.com/Univ-Wyo-Education/S22-1010/blob/main/homework/11/train-data.csv)

Take the 3 sections with the TODO's and implement them.

1. The conversion of columns from strings to float and from km to mi. Lines 62 to 73 in the file.
2. The one-hot encoding section. Lines 90 to 99 in the file.
3. The plots of data. Lines 120 to 123 in the file.

Turn in your finished code and a screen copy (image) of the 4 plots.
